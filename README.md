# Project Name: SinemaPrime

## Description

SinemaPrime is a movie rental platform designed to save users money by offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional streaming subscriptions. Rather than committing to a monthly subscription fee, users can simply rent the movies they want to watch, providing flexibility and potential cost savings for those who only occasionally use streaming services.

## Installation

As SinemaPrime is deployed on Netlify, installation may not be necessary. Users can access the platform directly through the provided URL.

## Deployed site

Deployed App: [Your App Name](https://sinemaprime.netlify.app/)

## Usage

Users can browse through the available movie collection, select the desired movie, and rent it for a specific duration. Once rented, users can have the movie directly on the platform. After the rental period expires, access to the movie is automatically revoked, but the user can return the movie once they are done with it.
